# Super-Hero

# Description of the project:

We are creating a game.The game we are going to create as a part of our python project is Super_hero (*we are still thinking of a better title* ). For this project we installed pygame before starting the project.Basically the game starts with a person at the bottom left of the screen with a person standing there. Above the person planks keep moving and as the person goes up the there will be more number of planks coming. There will be coins in between the planks which person has to collect gain score. While moving up if the person touches anyone one of the plank the game ends and the points he scored will be displayed. There will be dragons and guns which will be obstructions to the player. If the person crosses all the planks and reaches the  the gunman and the dragons start releasing bullets and fire respectively. If the person gets hit by fire or bullets the game ends and the points he scored will be displayed. From a distance above there will be thorns at the sides of the screen and also in this path there will be some coins and bombs. If the person takes coins his score will increase if he touches the bombs the game ends and the obtained score will be displayed on the screen. If the person successfully crosses a certain part of the game then the dragons and the gunmen stop firing. After this path will begin again and the planks will start coming .Person should move forward without touching the planks. There will be coins in between the planks which increases the score if the person collects them. If he touches any one of the planks he will lose the game and the score will be displayed.Here the number of planks decreases as the person moves up. If the person finally reaches the top of the screen after crossing all the hurdles in between then he should capture the flag that is present at top right corner of the screen. If the person captures the flag successfully he wins the game and the score he obtained will be displayed along with the congratulations to the person.
