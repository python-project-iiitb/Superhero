Abstract of the project

Our team chose to create a game with all the basic elements (a character, score, movements in objects , hurdles and music) that any usual game have using Pygame. In this project we focused on two major aspects other than completing it to get a desired output. They are Implementing the things we learnt in the course into this and exploring the features of the pygame by understanding its commands and instructions. We tried to implement the programing paradigms of python to the maximum extent we can. We accessed the control keys of our keyboard to play the game. The game is designed with 4 major hurdles. They are dragons with fire balls, gunmen with guns and bullets, cactus with thorns and the moving logs. If our superhero came in contact with any of these the game ends and you loose. To win the game one must collect all the coins and reach the flag in top right corner crossing all the obstacles in the way. The images that are used on screen were taken from the internet while the logs are drawn and programmed to merge and diverge from time to time. The music plays from the start to the end to give player an edge of experience while playing.
